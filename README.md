# The only Telemetry SDK you’ll ever need for TypeScript observability.

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=kubiks-inc/otel&type=Date&t=5)](https://www.star-history.com/#kubiks-inc/otel&Date)

## Vision

Observability should give engineers a clear view of what their systems are doing and not feel like another setup you have to wrestle with.

Our goal is to bring the TypeScript ecosystem the observability tools it’s been missing — built on the OpenTelemetry standard and designed to integrate natively with your favorite stack.
